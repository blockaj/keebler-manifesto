					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>We all know Keebler makes delicious cookies; the best in fact. Did you know that the reason Keebler cookies are so delicious is because they are made by real elves using real elven magic? Karl Marx did. In his Treatise on Why Keebler Will Fail, Marx addresses the structural flaws with the Keebler cookie company.</p>

					<h1>Section I</h1>
					<p>
						The secret behind Keebler&#39;s enticing treats are the laborers&#39; use of elven magic. Of course, elven magic is a scarce resource. Furthermore, elven magic that will improve the taste of cookies is even more scarce. Therefore, Keebler cannot easily trade laborers. Their laborers are the only ones who can produce such tasty products. Keebler Elves cannot be commodified like other laborers due to their specialized skill.

					<h1>Section II</h1>
					<p>
						I&#39;ve said before that specialized skill does not protect the jobs of the proletariat. Companies with huge resources can easily divide labor to a point of simplicity such that anyone can accomplish the task. At this point a big company can begin to commodify their laborers again. This cannot happen at Keebler. Keebler Elves have a skill that is intrinsic to them: making cookies. Their magic cannot be replicated and therefore, dividing labor among them does not help in commodifying the labor.

				<h1>Section III</h1>
					<p>
						Related to the commodification of labor, there is the issue of “means of production”. Since Keebler Elves possess the magic that makes the cookies so good they, in essence, own the means of production. Keebler elves are treated like the proletariat by all measures. They work like the proletariat, live like the proletariat and are payed like the proletariat. However, like the bourgeoisie, they own the means of production. Without the elves, it is impossible for Keebler to make a profit. Therefore, Keebler elves have all the negotiating power and the company has none. What is to stop the elves from taking all of the profit?

					<h1>Section IV</h1>
					<p>
						This scenario perfectly explains the true definition of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie has little to do with how much money one makes or how they are treated. The bourgeoisie is defined by what one owns. In the case of the Keebler elves, they own the means of production, therefore, they are the bourgeoisie.
